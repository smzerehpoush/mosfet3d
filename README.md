# Mosfet 3D

The NSF awarded ubuffalo.edu Java applets service for a set of
Educational Java Applets with semiconductors in mind known as
"The semiconductor Applet Service" (1996-2021) was closed recently.
The 2D MOS applet was my professor's favorite tool during the years
in his "Analog Integrated Circuits", "VLSI", and "Electronics I"
courses.


The ubuffalo's 2D version is now fully refurbished and
migrated from old days AWT and Java 1.1 to J2EE
and elevated from 2D to 3D by me.


I think this will help to teach MOS operation for a
broad range of courses by respected instructors/profs.
